My name is Marisol Reyes-Saucdeo, this is my first semester at California State University Fullerton. I am an Electrical Engineering Major hoping to graduate in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Lab

* Lab 5
Cpsc-120-lab-05-ian-marisol : 
Lab 5 had two parts, the first part was calculating the area of a rectangle and the second part was on converting decimal feet to feet and inches. This lab was one of my favorites because as straightforward as it was it tested my abilities with programming. I liked this lab because it allowed me to watch as numbers were being converted and taught me how to use simple logic and variables. It taught me how to break a problem down into more manageable steps leading to my desired output. With the lab I learned how to follow computer instructions as well as gained confidence in problem solving with code.

* Lab 7
Cpsc-120-lab-07-ryan-and-marisol : 
Lab 7 covered parking rules where we were to write functions implementing parking restrictions and rules using signs. I liked this lab because it tied with real world situations. It allowed me to turn rules into code which helped me understand the importance of reading and logical thinking as it forces you to pay attention to detail. Details such as time and conditions can change the outcome of a function leading to an undesirable result. 

* Lab 8
Cpsc-120-lab-08-marisol-kyle : 
Lab 8 was also two parts, the first part being calculating olympic judge average scores where there are multiple judges choosing a numerical score and we have to find the average mean and part 2 where we work with patterns with loops. Although this lab was challenging I enjoyed it because it implemented math, logic, and creativity. The first part allowed me to practice listing and eliminating scores while the second part allowed me to experiment with structure and repetition. It allowed me to see and practice two different approaches and coding techniques that can be applied to solve different forms of problems.
